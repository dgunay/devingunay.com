# Small Life Updates: November 2017

-----------------------------------

## Started Playing League Again

I started kind of playing League again. Now that preseason 8 has dropped, the game is fresh and interesting - albeit, kind of in janky ways. The game still needs serious tuning and rebalancing in the wake of its complete pregame statting system (runes) overhaul. Some runes are mostly irrelevant, some are really great, and some champions don't benefit much from any of the new runes, making them worse than those that do. Finally, everyone dies much more quickly since pure resistances/stats are very hard for most champions to access in the rune trees they want to go. It results in hectic games where most people aren't yet certain of how much damage they can do or have done to them.

I'm hoping that next year I can try again to reach Diamond - if not in solo queue, then at least in Flex.

## Gym Hiatus

My usual gym partner got deathly ill for a few weeks. This, in combination with the holiday season workload kind of made me able to mentally excuse myself from going. That's a really bad excuse and I should still be trying to go, but that's just how it shook out. Hoping to get back on it and likely discover I've lost little leg strength and almost all of my bench, just like last time this happened.

## Doki Doki Literature Club

I played [Doki Doki Literature Club](http://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/agecheck) with my girlfriend last week. I unfortunately managed to forget that the game was a psychological horror, as well as forget (over the course of about an hour) the trigger warnings in the load screen.

For those who have already played the game, I've written about my experience in the spoiler dropdown below. If you haven't played the game and enjoy horror, I would recommend it - it's free on Steam.

<summary>Spoilers inside!</summary>

<p>I basically walked into the game's very first gut punch with my abdomen completely relaxed.</p>

<p>The scene where you come upon the aftermath of Sayori's suicide by hanging left me  emotionally wrecked. A few seconds before clicking into the scene, I remembered:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a horror game.</li>
<li>There was a depression/anxiety warning on bootup.</li>
<li>Sayori had admitted to having depression the day before.</li>
</ul>

<p>I had just enough time to piece everything together and feel a spike of dread before witnessing the scene. It was pretty much the most high-impact way I could have experienced it, short of also being alone in a dark room.</p>

<p>We kept playing after that, but I was still reeling from the shock. Finally, a simple jump scare during Act 2 freaked me out enough in that state and I had enough.</p>

<p>When I play VNs, I tend to let my guard down and get emotionally invested. They're just so much better that way! Because I did this, for hours I was wracked with grief that my actions had led to Sayori's suicide (I had made the cavalier decision to go with any dialogue choice that put me on Yuri's path). I now know that Sayori would die no matter what, but even with that knowledge it took me hours to get it out of my head.</p>

<p>It has been 2 days and I only today feel like I can think about the scene somewhat dispassionately. If I think about it too hard, it still gets me really down. I consider myself a very sensitive person. The last time I witnessed something similarly traumatic in fiction (the elevator scene in Made in Abyss), it took me a week to get over it completely.</p>

<p>Despite how unpleasant I usually find horror games, I can appreciate that DDLC is a well-crafted horror game that uses metafiction elements very well. It's an objectively good game - I just don't handle horror games well.</p>

## Got a Smash 4 Setup

I managed to purchase a used Wii U and copy of Smash 4 for a very great price. I ordered the Mayflash Gamecube controller adapter from Amazon, and my practice partner lent me one of his original Gamecube controllers. I'm all set up and ready to tipper Fsmash the world.

I'm hoping to become the wifi warrior I've always dreamed of being when I have more free time. Now, it's entirely on me to put the practice time in.
