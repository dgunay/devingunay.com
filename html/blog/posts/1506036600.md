# Devin Makes a Website

My website is beginning to finally take shape! ... albeit I guess an ugly, malformed kind of shape sometimes but a shape nonetheless.

It shows how much my job is teaching me, I guess. My job has me doing very little actual web dev of my own, and mostly observing other people's websites. Yet just by doing that for 4-5 months and learning to interact with the web as a Linux server instead of a browser, I've learned enough to throw up a website. This would have probably taken me weeks to learn how to do before, but now getting hosting set up and then throwing Bootstrap onto it took less than a day. It's certainly not amazing or anything, but I looking back at how insurmountable I saw this task as before, it feels good. The only thing left is content creation, some more blind tinkering with Bootstrap, and a little PHP.

I don't expect it to amount to all that much - mostly, a way I can keep some of the stuff I make on display, and a web development playground. 

I am fully aware that I could have used a static site generator or CMS to run my blog, but as this site is just as much an exercise for me as it is a host for my content, I decided I would just handle the blog myself. Besides, the only thing on the line if it explodes in my face is my pride and whatever BS I'm writing. 

I decided to use [Parsedown](http://parsedown.org/) to format my blog posts, since looking at HTML makes my eyes bleed.
