# What Devin Listens To: Heavy Metal

Most people who know me eventually find out that I have some decently eclectic musical tastes. To explain where I got them, and how they've developed over time, I thought I'd write a small series of blog posts on it. I don't exactly have a ravenous fanbase, but at the end of it I'll get a convenient thing I can link people to when they ask about the weird stuff I listen to, at least.

In terms of closely-listened material, I think one of my top genres (broadly speaking) would be heavy metal.

I figured I would go with the one that raised the most eyebrows. Over the years I've received many *wonderful* comments such as 

> Really? You don't look/seem like you would.

-----------

> You don't really dress 'metal'.

-----------

> I don't believe you.

Yeah.

Nowadays, I don't get such comments super often, but I also now generally keep my music to myself unless in certain company.

## How It Started

In my early teens, I played a lot of the [Tony Hawk's Pro Skater](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tony_Hawk%27s_Pro_Skater) series, along with a few other games like ATV Offroad Fury. The soundtracks featured a lot of aggressive punk, alt, and other heavy-ish sounds.

Some of my most fondly-remembered tracks from the games:

- [Alice in Chains - Them Bones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFgAE5SgFnw)
- [Bender - Isolate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2mdzcOXrmE)
- [Powerman 5000 - When Worlds Collide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsV500W4BHU)
- [Sevendust - Denial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGUflZS7jG0)

So I go a few years having this kind of sound subliminally influencing me. Eventually, I go to Turkey and interact with my cousin during his heavy metal phase. He introduces me to a few bands like [Slipknot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko7eTB4xNDo) and [Tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOKV9Stri_M). From then on, I was hooked. 

My cousin's phase ended a long time ago and he now is a house/EDM DJ, but it wasn't a phase for me. I can't ever see myself not listening to metal in the future unless it literally becomes illegal.

## How Things Developed

As I went into middle and high school, my tastes got heavier and more technical. I began listening to a lot of melodic death - my favorite band in middle school was [In Flames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NY3A2RIaUs). I also really loved some very dark bands like [Dimmu Borgir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08OaE9Z3msQ) at the time. A brooding teenager... unique, I know. Bridging the gap for me at times were lighter alt metal bands such as [Breaking Benjamin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4ZHpYTd3hQ) and, later, [Chevelle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KPMIvK2_g4).

Later in high school I got very into prog and thrash bands, especially where the two subgenres would intersect. [Mastodon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm9P1QsoGhw) supplanted In Flames as my favorite band after In Flames' sound developed in ways that I continue to find distasteful.

In college, my interest in metal kind of dipped for a while. I did not do a whole lot of new listening, but generally when I did the trend of prog/thrash being my favorite thing continued and I fell in love with bands like Vektor and [3 Inches of Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BH7gI39fH8k).

(I am still salty that I never got to see them live before they broke up).

Overall, the biggest shift in how I consume metal is in how discriminating I am about what goes into my playlists. I used to only pick the maybe 2-4 songs off a given album I liked and keep them with me on my iPod since I was paying money per song and wanted to maximize value. Nowadays, if I like a band's general sound, I'll put a few of their albums on [my giant heavy metal playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/12127849215/playlist/1bE7ZqTvd8t7hhVS59rWN8).

I attribute the paradigm shift to:

- My music history studies drastically relaxing the criteria of what I consider "listenable" music.
- A transition from active to passive listening.
- Streaming a near endless catalog of any music I want instead of spending a limited childhood allowance on individual iTunes tracks.

Additionally, [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/2wfetb/metal_repetition_and_beer_a_thought_experiment/?utm_term=96663ae6-c02c-4f0c-99bd-fc8281495d4a&utm_medium=search&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=Metal&utm_content=1) did a lot to help open me up to the mindset of giving music a chance to 'click' with me, instead of expecting love at first listen.

## Where I'm At With Metal Today

I'll listen to damn near any metal passively if it has a decent groove. My master playlist is beginning to be dominated by groove metal with riffs one can nod along to.

For active listening though, I prefer concept albums. Albums I can sit down with and dive into the lyrics. Albums like [Slough Feg - Traveller](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Traveller_(Slough_Feg_album)). A lot of my favorite metal has at least somewhat compelling lyrics - all the better that the album hold a narrative that I can get into. Concept albums are especially great on long car rides, where I generally get some solitude.

I am hoping that some day I can get back to more active listening. Currently I get tons of passive listening but don't have a lot of time left in my day to *only* listen to music. There is such a great diversity of metal out there that I would like to sit down with instead of just put on in the background.
