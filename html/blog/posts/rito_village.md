# Breath of the Wild: Rito Village

_*Warning: music theory ahead.*_

Earlier in the year, I played The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on my
Switch. The game is great, of course - though I have some gripes with it, overall it 
is still easily one of my favorite games ever, and critiquing it as a whole is
beyond the scope of this post.

Instead, I'm here to talk about the background music of Rito Village.

Listen to it.

If you need a refresher or some context, listen to [Dragon Roost Island from The Wind Waker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7fqllhtdHI).
I'll be comparing the two heavily.

You'll probably notice right away that Rito Village contains all the themes in Dragon Roost Island. 

You'll also notice that __Rito Village is a breathtakingly beautiful piece of music.__ The composer(s) manage to take a somewhat simplistic but highly catchy and recognized tune, tweak everything about it, and come up with a result that is still utterly and fantastically great. 

Here's what's going on with it. 

### Texture

This is a change from the original in two respects.

To start with, the texture of Rito Village is far more complex. Dragon Roost Island has a small assortment of synthesized instruments - technology, especially data capacity, still posed limitations on music at the time, so the soundtrack [was synthesized using MIDI](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Wind_Waker#/Music).
However, Rito Village is a diverse range of live instruments, played by professionals with immaculate tone, into studio-quality recording equipment. The sheer quality of sound is frisson-inducing. It's funny - on a very basic level, it's all almost the same. The melody is there. The guitar supports throughout. But the introduction of bridging material, extra backing from piano and strings, a change from flute to mandolin and clarinet, all with world-class production value; it makes an absolute world of difference. 

The second major texture change is part of why Rito Village sounds so much more somber than Dragon Roost Island. Dragon Roost Island is at a very robust, danceable tempo. Rito Village drags its feet, not in a hurry to go anywhere. I mean that in the best way possible - it feels like a slow walk through a place of solemn, quiet contemplation. A place of regret, even.

### Reharmonization

Here we go. This is where I'm probably going to lose most people, but for the reader that sticks with me, I'll drop some chord progression knowledge. I also won't pull any terminological punches from here on out. 

Dragon Roost Island uses, for the most part, a very accessible chord progression built off of the Phrygian mode. All of the chords are triads. No extension. No borrowing from other modes. The harmonic rhythm is constant. 

The clarinet section of Rito Village is a complete reharmonization. It takes the chord progression of Dragon Roost Island from this:

> bVI - v7 - bVI - bVII 

To this:

> IV - iv6 - iii7 - bIII7(b5) - ii7(b5) - V7(b9) - I

That all happens in the same amount of measures. The changes aren't all on the same rhythm (change-2-3-change vs change-2-change-4), and there are simply more of them. It flows effortlessly down back to the tonic with a beautiful counterpoint. 

This moment of the piece is why I even bothered writing this post. This passage slays me. When I first heard it, I wept. I have a huge soft spot for half-diminished seventh chords, and really clever chord progressions in general. Everything else I described about this piece in combination with this chord progression just completely got to me. I've been away from the piano and away from making music for a while now since beginning my career, but moments like these remind me why I ever did it in the first place, and they call me back to making music. I am _this_ close to just transcribing it already. Would be a great excuse to get some stuff I want to hear played by [GME](https://www.facebook.com/gmeatucla/) again.

Excuse my tangent.

There are a lot of subtle reharmonizations throughout the piece, but that moment is such a high one I feel it best represents what an amazing job the composers did breathing new life into an old favorite. 

### The Soundtrack in General

The Breath of the Wild OST is a lot more understated compared to other Zelda games. Many fans, including myself, came away with the impression that it wasn't as recognizable because it wasn't as "theme-y" as previous entries. That is probably a fair assessment. 

To say it is any worse than other Zelda OSTs? That could not be more wrong, and Rito Village is the perfect rebuttal.
