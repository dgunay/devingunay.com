# Galaxy Note 4: End of Life Review

For going on 3 years now, my smartphone has been the [Samsung Galaxy Note 4](http://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-note-4-n910f/SM-N910FZKEBTU/). It has been my longest-held smartphone - the runner ups being my old iPhone 3GS and Galaxy S3, at 2 years.

Lately, the phone has begun to start really showing its age. The charging port no longer works with fast charge and USB debugging, probably due to hardware failure. It is shutting down at 10% battery left. Sometimes it even just reboots a few times. For the phone's whole life, it has had a camera focus problem (not getting that replaced under warranty is on me, though). But worst of all is that it is getting so.

Unbearably.

**Slow.**

As it is starting to really fall behind the performance that I want to get out of my smartphone, I will be getting a new phone around the holidays most likely. So it's the perfect time to review how the phone has been treating me (and how I, it) over the last 3 years.

### Physical condition

To start off, I'll go over how the phone as a piece of physical hardware has resisted the ravages of time.

The Gorilla glass definitely did its job, because I've dropped this phone dozens and dozens of times and yet the screen is as unscratched as the day I bought it. The metal sides, however, didn't fare too well and have a lot of nicks and small dents you can see from very close up. The faux-leather plastic back is totally fine.

All the buttons are in perfect working order - good considering that I hear about lots of people who own phones for too long often encountering issues such as their physical home buttons failing.

As I stated earlier, the only components to experience even partial failure are the camera and the USB port. 

Overall, the phone has an amazingly robust exterior and I have no real complaints about how it fared and how it looks after some wear and tear.

### What I liked about it

Prior to the Note 4, I had owned only standard size smartphones that easily fit in the palm of your hand. Getting used to the phablet size took a while, but I have biggish hands so I came to love it. People with small hands might find it obnoxious after a while though, even with features such as one-handed mode. 

The size and at-the-time good software performance allowed me to do things like administrate a large college club via Google Sheets and other apps. 

I did not find terribly much use out of the S-Pen, though it worked well when I did decide to use it and is great for sending cropped screenshots.

The phone, due to its size, held its own as a note-taking device in a pinch many times. With a name like Note, it simply had to.

In the first half of its life, the battery life was the best of any phone I have used. 

In order to counteract the effects of aging and getting left behind by advancing Android software, I appreciate that the battery was removable - I have 3 batteries, one that came with the phone and two [Anker](https://www.anker.com/ca/products/variant/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-4-3220mAh-Li-ion-Battery/A6035021) batteries. I just learned while writing this post that they have a double size battery. If I didn't have other problems with the Note 4, then honestly I might have just bought one of those and then continued on for another year.

The screen has always been beautiful and the camera was definitely top tier for its time and still delivers excellent shots - it's just very sensitive to the lighting. 

This was the first phone I've owned that has fast charge, and the feature is amazing. It probably cut down the battery life considerably, but I don't care because I have 2 spares I rotate to distribute load. 

### What I didn't like

Most of my issues with the phone came down to software.

Underscoring every issue that I had was the fact that AT&T shipped the phone with a locked bootloader, preventing you from rooting the phone and flashing a new ROM. This meant that I was basically stuck with the OS, whether I liked it or not. I really don't like that, and it felt especially rude that even after the warranty expired I still was stuck with it, since [no one has managed to get around the bootloader even after 3 years](https://forum.xda-developers.com/note-4-att/general/galaxy-note-4-root-progress-t2961974).

There are a lot of pre-installed apps that you cannot get rid of, including notorious battery-hogs such as the Facebook app that have been rumored to do sketchy stuff in the background using your microphone. You can disable them, but if you try to mass-update through the Google Play store, it will re-enable those apps. Hope you like painstakingly updating your apps one-by-one.

Update support has been pretty weak. I didn't get Marshmallow until very late, and it has stopped there.

The phone seemed to just not be able to keep up with running Android software after a while. Lots of places where the experience is laggy and slow, especially where it ought not to be like in the phone call screen. 

The phone cooperates poorly with Google Assistant, being very hit-or-miss in detection for reasons I suspect have more to do with the device hanging frequently and less to do with Google's voice recognition being bad. It has never reliably worked with the screen off despite that feature being enabled. I blame the fact that I had to fight Samsung's S Voice and disable it thoroughly, as well as the phone just being slow. I really like Google Assistant so the phone not being able to deliver a snappy experience there really sucks.

### Overall

Honestly, I suspect that were the phone rootable, I'd just root to fix my problems and keep on truckin' through 2018. It really does feel like I was that close to owning literally the best Android phone of all time. Unfortunately, since I got the AT&T version, it was just an extremely good phone that lasted me quite a good while.

My biggest lament about having to upgrade is that the biggest longevity-extending feature of the Note 4, the trivially replaceable battery, is pretty much gone on 2017 flagships. While it is probably still possible to replace the battery of most phones, the fact that I could bring a spare battery with me, take 20 seconds to pop it in, and have 100% charge like that, was a game changer. Hopefully the next phone I have will not have too much battery degradation, but I am going to miss quick swapping batteries.

Definitely though, if someone is looking for an old flagship, I would highly, highly recommend the Note 4, especially if you can root it. Will last you a very long time with great build quality, great screen, great camera, and a myriad of features.
