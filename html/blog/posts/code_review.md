# Code Review

Recently, at work, I had the experience of having one of my superiors code
review a project I had been working on for a few weeks. Many might not call it a 
pleasure, but I certainly would call it one. 

If I'm going to be a baller developer, then, as with most things that I strive 
to be good at, I need to dispense with my ego. I have stopped feeling much
remorse at all when people tell me my code is not correct or optimal. If it is
bad, I want to hear it. It's an attitude that can carry you far in almost
anything you do.

Do anything in isolation for too long, and you'll think that your way is the
best. You won't see that lurking mistake, your biases and preconceptions about
how your code ought to work hiding it in plain sight. 

I still remember taking a programming exam back in community college and having absolutely convinced myself that the tests were bugged, and my program was perfect.

Crazy, right? How arrogant.

The instructor just kept telling me I wasn't getting it, try again, you're not looking at it the right way. Bless his heart, I wish I had understood his bearded wisdom. I didn't figure it out until mulling it over in the car ride home. Boy was I embarrassed; it was all just a stupid and obvious segfault in my pointer arithmetic - basic stuff. 

That kind of attitude will hamstring your development at *anything*. I hear people say this all the time in Super Smash Brothers:

> What? How did that hit me? I was [doing a thing]!

It is the same fundamental misunderstanding of the problem, but combined with an inability to accept that they don't know something about what they're trying to do - in this case, usually the fact that what they were doing has some frames where they are vulnerable to being hit.

You can think like that, or you can ask yourself why that happened, and question your understanding of the situation. Because at the end of the day, Super Smash Brothers is mostly deterministic, and if something weird happens, there is a reason it played out that way.
