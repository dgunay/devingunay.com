# 2017 New Year's Resolutions Review

This was a big year for me.

Beginning of 2017, I made these resolutions:

- Continue to improve at the trumpet
- Reach Diamond in League of Legends again
- 2 plate squat, bodyweight bench, twice bodyweight deadlift, and overhead press my girlfriend's bodyweight.

My accomplishments this year actually fell short for all of these, but that's not actually that bad since they diverged off in other ways instead of me just becoming a worse person in general.

### Music

The frequency of my music making has been on a severe decline, but I don't consider myself much worse of a musician despite that.

At the beginning of the year, I was teaching piano lessons, playing biweekly at a solo gig, actively playing in two of Orange Coast College's jazz bands on piano and trumpet, playing trumpet in the OCC intermediate orchestra, and participating a bit in a small jazz band. I made time to play a few heads most nights, and generally stayed at least at a decent rate of trumpet practice on non-rehearsal days.

Now, I only touch the piano once or twice a month, haven't played trumpet in months, have quit teaching lessons, and have no gigs. 

I am undoubtedly a technically worse musician now than I was at the beginning of the year. However, I don't consider myself a worse musician *overall*, because of the habit I have developed of constant audiation. I am getting at least an hour or so of mental practice every day whenever I have a moment to idly think, or hear particularly engaging music.

No, it's not making my technique any better, but every time I sit back down at the piano I have fresh ideas and don't feel like it's been a very long time.

### Fitness

I set some lofty goals. And yet, I'm not actually that far off. My current lifts (some estimation involved):

- **Squat**: 180 lbs, 5 reps
- **Deadlift**: 225 lbs, 5 reps
- **Bench press**: 140 lbs, 5 reps
- **Overhead press**: 80 lbs, 5 reps

The only lift that I am hilariously far away from reaching my goal on is overhead press.

Earlier in the year, my workout adherence was terrible. I was skipping gym for weeks on end; I was thoroughly demotivated after suffering an injury in late 2016, and also was growing extremely tired of the 20+ minute commute to my gym. Little to no progress was made, and by summer I had slid back a bit on my numbers.

Circumstances changed when I got my summer internship, which placed me within walking distance to a powerlifting-friendly gym weekdaily and on a similar schedule to two of my friends who actively go to the gym. Lowering the barrier like that really helped. I didn't (and still don't) do as much volume per workout as before I hurt myself, but I almost never skip more than two days of gym now. And consistency works, who knew!

Focusing on my squat hard has really helped, and I'm only 45 lbs away from the squat goal. The deadlift goal is still kind of far away, but I reckon if I ate a lot of protein and just went completely ham on my squat I could knock out a two plate squat for at least a few reps by the end of the year, or come close.

My bench press is also coming along, though admittedly it is at the expense of my overhead press. I absolutely hate overhead press, and that attitude probably isn't helping me get any better at it. Usually when I don't feel like doing OHP, I just bench instead.

### Competitive Gaming

This year, I did not play very much League of Legends. Even more embarrassingly, the season is going to end in half a month and I literally have not finished my solo queue placements. This will be the first season that I go unranked in solo queue.

However, I *did* manage to get Platinum in Flex queue. Flex queue isn't as serious, and I definitely don't take it as seriously, but ironically that probably is why I was able to climb up to Plat - one of my biggest weaknesses in League is that I have horrible queue anxiety. Being able to treat it almost like an unranked queue and play with a friend or two really takes the edge off.

That's not to say I had tons of time for League anyway. The transition from underemployed college student to full-time worker made me go from playing League up to 5 matches a day to getting in maybe 5 matches a week.

I also got *way* more into Smash 4 this year. Every chance I got, I put time in with one of my close friends to practice Smash. I watch competitive Smash 4 every day.

A year and a half ago, I picked up Marth. I had been juggling a bit of Ganondorf and other side characters, but later in 2017 I committed hard to playing a clean solo main Marth. My Marth is cleaner and more optimal than my Ganon ever was.

I also made it out to a few tournaments this year, and I learned something new every time I went. Particularly I feel I am making gains in my ability to play neutral effectively and adjust mid-set. After all, you only have 4 stocks to make adjustments in your tactics in a best of three.

I am still lamenting not having a setup to practice on, but I try to remain optimistic about a possible Smash release on the Switch. If it's too far away, I am even considering getting a setup secondhand.

### What Happened?

By far the biggest event of 2017 for me was my internship turning into a full-time job and then moving out of my dad's place. That changed so much for me.

Suddenly, I'm not rolling out of bed at noon on a weekday after playing League until 3 AM, and also value games I can play in short bursts.

Suddenly, I'm back to going to the gym up to 3 times a week.

Suddenly, I have basically dropped the trumpet.

Getting a real, career-jumpstarting job might have thrown me a bit off all these resolutions, but that's fine, because it was the best thing I could have done; and yet, I didn't even put it down as a goal.

This is definitely one of my best years, even if I never make it to a two plate squat, I never get to Diamond again, or I never pick up the trumpet again.

Because this year, I feel like my adult life has truly begun.
