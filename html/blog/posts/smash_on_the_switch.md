# The Curious Case of Smash 4 (for the Nintendo Switch?)

My favorite competitive game, alongside League of Legends, is Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.

Ironically though, I have never owned a truly serious practice setup for the game. I do have it for the 3DS - however, that places limitations on my technical skill, and also pollutes my muscle memory with compensatory habits. I don't use it as a result.

Nevertheless, I watch competitive Smash 4 constantly and play with my practice partner whenever I can.

## What's so great about it?

I love the Smash series, but Smash 4 stands apart from the rest as a competitive game mainly because of two things: game balance and systematism.

### Game balance

Smash has a history of soloistic design by the man himself: Masahiro Sakurai.

Everything prior to Smash 4 was, to a great degree, hand-designed, tested, and balanced by Sakurai. It explains a lot, especially Melee's miraculously-accidental viability as an evergreen competitive fighting game, and Brawl's subsequent lack of competitive longevity due to actively anti-competitive design.

However, Smash 4 [was developed with an expanded in-house playtesting team](http://sourcegaming.info/2015/06/11/the-act-of-balancing-sakurai-famitsu-column-vol-480/), and *boy* does it really show. Especially after rounds of balance patches (with data gathered from online matches), Smash 4 has easily the smallest distance between top and bottom tier of any Smash game. It is still far from what I would personally call balanced, but you can at least play over half the cast and still be respectable as a serious Smash player in tournament.

### Systematism

If you compare the combo games of Melee and Smash 4, they are both deep systems in their own right. However, the origin of these systems are starkly different. 

<!-- where Melee's combo game is emergent from the overarching decision to have high hitstun and a few likely unforeseen physics engine quirks, Smash 4's is the result of the designers deliberately applying design patterns to most characters.  -->

In Melee, combos arise organically from the complex interplay between hitstun, DI, teching, and various speed-enhancing techniques such as wavedashing and L-cancelling.

In Smash 4, many moves are obviously and deliberately tuned to set up scenarios where the attacking and defending players have to choose an option, and then their choices are resolved against each other. A good example is [the 50/50 situation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rtNPNzsRz0). Moves that, in the past, guaranteed a followup such as Diddy Kong's down throw have even been nerfed to not immediately lead to a kill at high percentages, unless you get a read. 

There are many other systems like this. Jab-lock setups, ledge trumping, and footstool combos to name a few. And they each usually have some kind of decision making minigame you can do to counter it (tech to avoid, buffer a getup option, mix up your DI, respectively). It makes for huge highs when you play an intense match and then pull out a read during one of those scenarios to finish your opponent - and this is by design since these systems affect almost all characters.

Similar situations do often arise in Melee, though because of how haphazard its design is as a whole, Melee is what I would consider poorly balanced. While there are many characters you can be a serious threat with, the distance between top and bottom tier in Melee is far greater than that of Smash 4.

That isn't to say that Smash 4 is a perfect game, but in my opinion something with Smash 4's model (a consistent and competitively-mindful design philosophy, decent balance patch support, and serviceable online play) is the best metagame model for Super Smash Bros. It is vaguely reminiscent of the thoroughly designed and rigid nature of a traditional fighting game, but with the same fluidity and improvisational nature of Smash. And it's *still* an insanely fun party game.

## Ok, what's your point

Because it is tied to a dead console and a gimped handheld, *I cannot own the definitive Smash 4*. It makes no financial sense for me to drop $200 on a refurbished Wii U, another $50 on the game itself, another chunk of cash for the gamecube adapter, and have to go wrangle an out-of-production Gamecube controller just to have a competitive setup.

Bear in mind, *this is the iteration of Smash Bros. to which Nintendo has chosen to provide any level of support for the competitive scene*.

Meanwhile though, I am fully invested in the Switch. It is a unique console fulfilling a great use-case niche and has a strong future. Nintendo has already set a precedent of porting their strong past releases with the release of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for the Switch. Smash 4 is [in the top 4 best-selling Wii U games](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_best-selling_Wii_U_video_games), even with the 3DS having arguably cannibalized sales to a degree.

Smash 4 maintains a strong competitive scene despite Wii U consoles becoming harder and harder to acquire. For Nintendo to release a port, along with possible balance patches and another production cycle of Gamecube controllers and adapters, would be a strong show of support for the competitive scene.

Finally, I am willing to bet that there are a lot of people out there like me who skipped out on the Wii U, but would love to purchase the games they missed now on the Switch. Releasing a port would ease the burden of acquiring and maintaining setups on tournament organizers, as well as prompt a new surge of people excited to own for themselves what they could only watch from afar previously - people both casual and competitively-inclined.

## Final thoughts

I don't think that releasing a Smash 4 port at all precludes the release of another Smash game on the Switch. If the Switch maintains a decent longevity (which I feel it certainly can), I'm pretty sure that would leave an acceptable amount of time between 2017-18 and a possible Smash 5.

This post kind of ballooned way past the scope I had intended it to be (just me moaning about how I still can't play Smash 4 the way I want), but nevertheless I think it serves as a decent argument for why Smash 4 deserves a bit more support. I think that Melee is still an amazing game, but realistically I feel it doesn't make financial sense for Nintendo to support it. Not supporting Smash 4 more, however, is equally perplexing to me, especially given how monetizable esports is proving to be. Official support beyond token acknowledgement would, in my opinion, push the competitive Smash scene past its grassroots limitations. [Nintendo's public stance is a relatively hands-off acknowledgement](https://compete.kotaku.com/nintendo-responds-to-smash-bros-pros-callout-wants-to-1796177733), but I think it would be awesome to see even a little bit more given that they seem to be dipping their toes in things with Splatoon.
